Real time bus track using API to source real time data for bus movements in Boston

One of the first things you want to do is acquire your own access token from mapbox.com

Start with making your array of all the latitude and longitude locations of each bus stop
You'll add your access token after this step using open API that is already instilled by mapbox

Build your map. You can do this by naming your "container," styles, and center of where you want your map to start.

Add your marker with open API from mapbox.

Build your timer using a call back function and if/else statement.

This will allow real time tracking of bus routes. Try it out!
